# MaterialCordova
A template for creating Apache Cordova apps with Google's Material Design guidlines.
# Why MaterialCordova?
Why don't I just use another library, like polymer for my material design? 
Because! MaterialCordova allows you to create your app as if it was actual html5. Also, MaterialCordova supports Windows 8 apps!
